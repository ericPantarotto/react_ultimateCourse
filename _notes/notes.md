## A first Look at React

### React vs. Vanilla JavaScript

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** *React* and all these other front-end frameworks are really good at keeping the data automatically in sync with the user interface.

we would really need to create a lot of extra code that, with React, we don't have to, again, because it automatically takes care of keeping the data in sync with the user interface.

### What is React?

So React is basically a huge **abstraction away from the DOM** so that we never have to work with a DOM directly as we would with vanilla JavaScript.

So we simply tell React what we want to happen when some data changes, but not how to do it. And again, we do that using **JSX**.

### Pure React

So, we have no modules here, we have no way of converting JSX, we have no HTTP server which automatically reloads the application and so on.
